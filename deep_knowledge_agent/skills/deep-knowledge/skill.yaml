# Description
description: |
  Performs comprehensive, multi-domain research and knowledge synthesis on complex topics.
  Breaks down queries into sub-topics, validates information across sources, identifies
  patterns and cross-domain connections, and delivers structured, well-reasoned outputs.
  Designed for deep technical, academic, and investigative analysis rather than surface-level answers.

  overview: |
    The Deep Knowledge skill provides structured, multi-stage research and synthesis
    for complex or multi-domain questions. It decomposes queries into logical components,
    validates information through cross-referencing, and synthesizes findings into
    coherent, research-grade outputs. It is designed for academic, professional,
    and technical investigations where depth and reasoning transparency matter.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Complex research requiring multiple perspectives"
      - "Technical or academic domain exploration"
      - "Cross-domain knowledge synthesis"
      - "Strategic decision support requiring deep analysis"
      - "Professional investigative research tasks"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Simple factual questions (use general assistant)"
      - "Real-time live information requests"
      - "Mathematical calculations"
      - "Code generation or debugging"
      - "Creative writing or opinion-only tasks"

  input_structure: |
    Accepts research-oriented queries in plain text or structured JSON.

    Example (Plain Text):
    "Research the economic and geopolitical implications of semiconductor supply chain disruptions"

    Example (JSON):
    {
      "query": "Research topic or question",
      "depth": "quick | standard | deep | exhaustive",
      "focus_areas": ["domain1", "domain2"],
      "exclude_sources": ["domain_to_exclude"],
      "max_iterations": 5,
      "output_format": "structured | narrative | both"
    }

    Constraints:
    - Maximum 1000 characters for query field
    - Maximum 10 iterations
    - Timeout: 120 seconds
    - English language preferred

  output_format: |
