# Description
description: |
  Deep Knowledge Agent is an advanced AI research assistant designed for in-depth analysis,
  knowledge synthesis, and comprehensive research on complex topics. It breaks down queries
  into sub-topics, validates facts, connects insights across domains, and delivers structured,
  well-reasoned outputs. This skill enables deep research, technical exploration, and
  knowledge synthesis rather than providing surface-level answers.

  overview: |
    The Deep Knowledge Agent specializes in thorough, well-researched analysis of complex topics.
    Unlike surface-level assistants, it performs iterative searches, breaks down queries into
    manageable components, validates information across multiple sources, and synthesizes
    comprehensive answers with proper citations. It's designed for users who need in-depth
    understanding rather than quick answers, making it ideal for research, technical analysis,
    and knowledge exploration tasks.

  use_cases:
    when_to_use:
      - "Complex research requiring multiple perspectives"
      - "Technical topics needing thorough exploration"
      - "Fact-checking and validation of claims"
      - "Domain exploration and knowledge synthesis"
      - "Academic or professional research support"
      - "Decision-making requiring comprehensive analysis"

    when_not_to_use:
      - "Simple factual questions (use general assistant)"
      - "Real-time information requests (use news/search agent)"
      - "Mathematical calculations (use calculator agent)"
      - "Code generation or debugging (use programming agent)"
      - "Personal advice or opinion-based responses"
