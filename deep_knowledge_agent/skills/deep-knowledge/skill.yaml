  best_practices:
    for_developers:
      - "Use async/await for all agent operations"
      - "Implement graceful degradation for partial failures"
      - "Cache API responses to reduce latency"
      - "Test with various query types and edge cases"

    for_orchestrators:
      - "Route complex queries to this skill"
      - "Expect 5-30 second processing time per request"
      - "Monitor agent response times and API rate limits"
